            <h2>100 Years of Women in the House of Representatives</h2>
            <h3><span style="padding-right: 5rem;">By <b>Durand D'souza</b></span><span><b>June 25, 2018</b></span></h3>
            <p>
                The first woman was elected to the House of Representatives on November 7th, 1916, ending a over a century of Congress entirely composed of men . Since then, 288 different women have represented their constituents in the House, closing the gender gap to 19% women. This is the story of how we got here and the potential for a dramatic improvement in the 2018 election.

                            <hr /> Republican Jeannette Rankin was the first woman to be elected to national office. She first rose to prominence as a campaigner for women's suffrage in Montana, and in 1916 she won one of Montana's two "at-large" House seats. While she did lose the next election due to a change in the state's electoral rules, she returned to the House in 1941. A lifelong pacifist, Rankin voted against US engagement in both world wars. She is the only woman elected to Congress from Montana.

                            <hr /> Patsy Matsu Takemoto Mink (竹本 まつ), a liberal Democrat from Hawaii, was the first woman of color to be elected to Congress. She served 12 terms in the House of Representatives, was an early critic of the Vietnam war, and fought for various causes such as women's rights, labor unions, and civil liberties. She famously co-authored Title IX, a civil rights law that promoted gender equality in education.

                            <hr /> Shirley Chisholm became, in 1968, the first black woman elected to Congress, and in 1972, the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. She famously said, “I ran because somebody had to do it first” after earning 152 delegates at the national convention. While in Congress, she was an unabashed supporter of her constituents in Brooklyn, NY, championing daycare funding, minimum wages, and gender equality.

                        The Nordic countries lead in equal gender representation, although Mexico has also made great strides. Many of these countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and Mexico have also implemented gender quotas to improve representation, although Iceland, notably, has not.

                        The US, on the other hand, ranks 28th out of 34. None of these countries have made it to gender parity. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet or exceed 50% women in governing bodies are Bolivia and Rwanda (not visualized here), both of which also have gender quotas.

                        With gender parity, constituents might hope that that elected official focus on more inclusive issues (as, for example, Patsy Mink had with Title IX legislation). To better understand how a gender shift in Congress might affect the topics debated by our representatives, consider the speeches made by House members.

                        From the Congressional Record, we compiled a collection of 500,000 speeches delivered by men and women in the House from 1994 to the present, including monologues, debates, single sentence replies, and even acknowledgements praising particular individuals.

We label <b>Topic 1</b> as <i>“energy policy”</i> and <b>Topic 2</b> as <i>“natural disasters”</i>.

<br/>
For example, if we input the sentence “Wind and solar power are renewable energy sources while natural gas is a fossil fuel.”, the model outputs  that is 84% about the “energy policy” topic whereas “There is a lot of natural gas in the middle east.” is only 46% about “energy policy”. Speeches can also be composed of multiple topics.

                        Men and women representatives appear to spend roughly equal amounts of their speeches on energy policy. Next, let’s examine another topic, one to which  women devote more of their speeches: <i>“healthcare”</i>.

                        In the upcoming 2018 midterm elections, a record number of women have filed to (or are planning to) run for a House seat (as of May 2018) and there is still time to file. The outcome has the potential to dramatically shift the gender breakdown of the House.

                We’ve seen how far we’ve progressed towards a 50:50 House of Representatives and we’ve seen how much further we have to go. We’ve also seen that both parties need to make much more progress to keep up with the international stage. And finally we’ve seen that more women in Congress does change the content of the debate.
