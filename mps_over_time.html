Mink was a third generation Japanese American and member of the Democratic Party. She also was the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.

                    Over the past 100 years, we've seen some progress in Congress. Since 1917, the House of Representatives has been graced by the presence of <b>288</b> women and the Senate by the presense of <b>51</b> women. There are
                    currently <b>89</b> women in the House and <b>22</b> women in the Senate. Hover/tap on the lines and toggle the zoom slider to zoom in and explore.

                    Let's now look at how close we are to a 50:50 Congress.

                    <b>89</b> women representatives is significant, but we still haven't hit 50:50 yet. In fact, for every woman currently serving in the House of Representatives, there are 3.9 men. Hover/tap on the graph to see the ratio of men to women for each Presidential term.

                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="1">
                    The situation is also very party dependent. In 2018, 33% of Democratic House Reps are women. [Placeholder text]
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="2">
                    But only 10% of Republicans in the House are currently women. [Placeholder text]

                <div class="step" data-slide="1" data-step="4">
                    So both parties need to do better to attract women to the job. Overall, 20% of House Reps are women. And how does this compare to other developed countries? Let's take a look!
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="2" style="opacity: 0;">

                    <p>
                        Right! On this graph, we see the % of women elected to the equivalent of the House of Representatives in other developed countries. For Norway, this is the <em>Stortinget</em>, for Mexico, <em>Cámara de Diputados</em>, for the United Kingdom,
                        it is the <em>House of Commons</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As usual, the Nordic countries lead the pack. Mexico has also made great strides recently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The US is in fact quite regressive when compared to the rest of the developed world. You may also note that none of these countries have made it to equal gender representation yet. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet this threshold are Bolivia and Rwanda.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="3" data-step="0">
                    <p>
                        At this point, you may be thinking - <em>great, I've seen how much progress we've made. I've been introduced to a few women. And I know how much further we have to go. But why? What does a 50:50 Congress give us that we don't have already?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s look at how much time House Representatives spend speaking about the different issues that concern them. We collected 500,000 speeches from 1994 to the present day and analysed them using machine learning.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="0">
                    <p>

                        Here’s the chart for the topic “ENERGY”. Each dot in this chart represents one representative (from 1994 to today). The higher the dot, the greater the proportion of their time in the House was spent talking about energy policy. Hover/tap on each dot to see who they
                        are and their percentage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The horizontal position of a dot is meaningless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Men and women reps appear to spend roughly equal amounts of their time on energy policy. Next, let’s take a look at another topic, one which women tend to devote more speaking time to.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="1">
                    <p>
                        And here's the chart for the topic “HEALTHCARE”. Women reps clearly spend more of their time discussing healthcare and medicine than men.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What about a topic favoured by men?
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="2">
                    <p>
                        Finally, a chart for the topic “GOVERNMENT BUDGET”. This time, we see that men spend [...] as much time talking about the budget and taxes than women.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="3">
                    <p>
                        We can represent the difference between the median time spent by each gender with a line.
                    </p>
                    Let's take this median line and plot it with the median lines of all the other topics.
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="5" style="opacity: 0;">
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="5">
                    <p>
                        We see that women representatives spend more of their time than men time talking about HEALTHCARE, CIVIL RIGHTS, LABOR RIGHTS and the ENVIRONMENT.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        And we can see that male representatives spend more of their time than women talking about the BUDGET.

            <p>So let’s wrap this up!</p>

            <p>

                We’ve seen how far we’ve progressed towards a 50:50 Parliament and we’ve seen how much further we have to go. We’ve also seen which political parties have made the most progress, and how Britain compares internationally. And finally we’ve seen that more
                women in parliament does change the content of the debate.
