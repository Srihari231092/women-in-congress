            <h2>100 Years of Women in the United States House of Representatives</h2>
            <p>
                The first woman was elected to the House of Representatives on November 7th, 1916. Since then, 288 diferent women have represented their constituents and redefined the state of American politics. But does equal gender representation matter? In this piece,
                we dive into the colorful history of women in politics and look through the lens of data visualization and machine learning. By analyzing 500,000 speeches delivered in the House of Representatives over the last 25 years, we measure the
                impact of gender on the political discourse.

                            <hr /> Republican Jeannette Rankin was the first woman to be elected to national office. She first rose to prominence as a campaigner for women's suffrage in Montana, and in 1916 won one of Montana's two "at-large" House seats. While
                            she did lose the next election due to a change in the state's electoral rules, she returned to the House in 1941. A lifelong pacifist, Rankin voted against US engagment in both world wars. She is to date the only woman elected
                            to Congress from Montana.

                            <hr /> Patsy Matsu Takemoto Mink (竹本 まつ), a liberal Democrat from Hawaii, was the first woman of color to be elected to Congress. She had a long and distinguished career, serving 12 terms in the House of Representatives, as well
                            as in numerous other posts. She was an early critic of the Vietman war and fought for various causes such as women's rights, labor unions and civil liberties. One of her greatest achievements was the passing of a bill to promote
                            gender equality in education, to increase job opportunities for women and to remove gender stereotypes from school textbooks.

                            somebody had to do it first” after earning a respectable 152 delegates at the national convention. While in Congress, she was an unabashed supporter of her constituents in Brooklyn, NY, championing daycare funding, minimum
                            wages and gender equality.

                    <p>
                        Visualized here is the % of women elected to the equivalent of the House of Representatives in other developed countries (in the OECD). In Norway, this is the <em>Stortinget</em>, in Mexico, <em>Cámara de Diputados</em>, for the
                        United Kingdom, it is the <em>House of Commons</em>.

                    <p>
                        The Nordic countries lead the OECD in equal gender representation although Mexico has also made great strides recently. Many of these countries have also implemented gender quotas to improve representation (although Iceland, notably, has not).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The US, on the other hand, is quite regressive and ranks 28th out of 34 in the OECD. Notice also that none of these countries have made it to equal gender representation yet. In fact, the only two countries in the world to meet or exceed this threshold
                        are Bolivia and Rwanda, both of which also have gender quotas.

                        At this point, you may be thinking - <em>great, I've seen how much progress we've made. I've been introduced to a few important women. And I know how much further the country has to go. But why? What does a 50:50 Congress give us that we don't have already?</em>

                    <p>
                        Here's what we can do to answer this question:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Gather a bunch of speeches made by representatives.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Make a machine learning model that can identify the topics within a speech automatically because we're lazy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Tally up all the times a representative spoke about a particular topic.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Compare the difference in time spent by each gender.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Identify which topics have a bias towards one gender or another.

                    <p>
                        We scraped and cleaned <span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>Cleaning the text is a common step in natural language processing. It involves removing all words that convey no meaning or that might be misleading, converting words to their root form (eg. learning, learnt → learn) and combining words that appear together often into a single word (eg. “nuclear power” → “nuclear_power”)</span></span>                        a corpus of 500,000 speeches delivered by men and women in the House of Representatives between 1994 and the present day from the Congressional Record. This included long monologues, debates, single sentence replies and acknowledgements
                        praising particular individuals (of which there were many!).

                    <p>
                        We then used a probabilistic machine learning model called <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@lettier/how-does-lda-work-ill-explain-using-emoji-108abf40fa7d">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> (LDA) to help us infer the
                        topics within a speech. <span class="footnote"><sup>2</sup><span>While there are a number of different machine learning techniques that can do this, including neural networks, the beauty of LDA is that it is an unsupervised learning algorithm - ie. unlike most other algorithms, it does not require a bunch of pre-labelled speeches to train it. This was important to us because we didn't want to bias the inference process by selecting the topics in advance.</span></span>                        The only necessary inputs are the corpus of speeches and a rough guess of the total number of topics within the corpus. LDA then iteratively tries to identify this number of topics by looking for words that often appear together
                        and clustering them into the same topic. <span class="footnote"><sup>3</sup><span>For example, if we choose a small number of topics - let's say 10 - it will simply identify the 10 most overarching themes in congressional speeches. Since we wanted to identify more subtle topics and themes, after a bit of experimentation, we settled on 75. As is often the case with LDA models, many of the topics identified were nonsensical, but the majority were well-defined.</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p style="display: inline;">After leaving the model to compute for a few hours, it returned with a bunch of topics such as heathcare, energy policy, war &amp; foreign policy, national security, and so on.
                        <div class="footnote"><sup>4</sup><span>Of course, LDA doesn't output these names. It simply gives us a list of words and phrases that are most closely associated with a particular topic and it is up to us to name the topic.<br/>

                    We then ran the model on each of the 500,000 speeches to identify the topics within them. Due to the inherent uncertainty in probabilistic modelling, there will be some misidentification<span class="footnote"><sup>5</sup><span>For example, if we input the sentence <i>“Wind and solar power are renewable energy sources while natural gas is a fossil fuel.”</i>, the model tells us that is 84% about the “energy policy” topic whereas <i>“There is a lot of natural gas in the middle east.”</i> is only 46% about “energy policy”. Speeches can also be composed of multiple topics.</span>
                </span>. However, these errors should not affect our analysis
                    as longer speeches are labelled more accurately and also have a greater contribution to the final result.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We then tallied up the time spent by each rep. on each topic and normalised it to give us a fractional time.

                    <p>
                        Okay, enough with the delays already! Let's look at the results. Scroll on!

                        Here is the topic <i>“energy policy”</i> visualized. Each dot in this chart represents a particular House rep., with men on the left and women on the right. The higher the dot, the greater the proportion of their time in the House was spent talking about energy
                        policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hover/tap on a dot to see discover who it is and how long they spent on energy policy. You can also use the search bar to find your own rep. by entering either your district (eg. California 12) or their name (Nancy Pelosi).

                    <p>
                        We can represent the difference between the median time spent by each gender with a line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Male and female reps. appear to spend roughly equal amounts of their time on energy policy. Next, let’s take a look at another topic, one which women tend to devote more speaking time to.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="2">
                    <p>
                        So here's the topic <i>“healthcare”</i>. This is a significant topic for both genders but women reps. still spent more than twice as much time discussing healthcare and medicine than men did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's quite a startling discovery. Since Democrats spend more time talking about healthcare than Repulicans, and Democratic women far outnumber Republican women, while the opposite is true for Republican men, you might think that this accounts for the
                        difference between the genders. However, if you take each party independently, the result is almost exactly the same which means that the bias is almost exclusively down to gender. <span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup><span>You can see a breakdown by party in <a href="https://rawgit.com/dldx/women-in-congress/master/violin_plot.html" target="_blank">this violin plot</a>.</span></span>

                    <p>
                        Now let's look at a topic favoured by men.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="4" data-step="3">
                    <p>
                        Here's the topic <i>“government budget”</i>. This time, we see that men spent more time talking about the budget and taxes than women did. However the gender difference isn't as extreme. The majority of our topics seemed to be either biased towards women or neutral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's take the median difference line for this topic and plot it with lines representing all the other topics.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="step" data-slide="5" style="opacity: 0;">

                    <p>
                        A difference of +100% (eg. <i>“child welfare”</i>) means that women spend twice as much time as men talking about the topic. A difference of -100% means that men spend twice as much time as women talking about the topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So female representatives spend more of their time than men time talking about <i>healthcare</i>, <i>civil rights</i>, <i>labor rights</i> and the <i>environment</i>...

                    <p>

                        ...and male representatives spend more of their time than women talking about the <i>military</i>, <i>agriculture</i> and the <i>budget</i>.

            <p>So let’s wrap this up!</p>

            <p>

                We’ve seen how far we’ve progressed towards a 50:50 Parliament and we’ve seen how much further we have to go. We’ve also seen which political parties have made the most progress, and how Britain compares internationally. And finally we’ve seen that more
                women in parliament does change the content of the debate.
